        <h1>Night One: LA 8-3-23</h1>
        <p>Traffic wasn't as bad as expected. So-Fi stadium was ell equipted to handle the 70,000 person sold out crowd. We didn't wait for food, drinks, or bathroom. The surprise songs were:
            <ul>
                <li>"I Can See You" - Speak Now, Taylor's Version, From the Vault</li>
                <li>"Maroon" - Midnights</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
